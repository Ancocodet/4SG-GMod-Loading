### Issues

- If you're **reporting a bug**, please include all relevant details.
	- A descriptive title helps for one. Titles of just "Error" or "It doesn't work" really don't help.
	- Please describe what you're trying to do, what actually happens, and what you can do to reproduce the problem.
	- If you have an error message or a crash, please include the full text of the error message and the stack trace.
	- Include the relevant snippet of your code. Wrap it in /* JS- Code */

- If you're **requesting a feature**, please be descriptive and understanding.
	- A good title makes a difference. Please briefly describe what you're requesting in the title.
	- Be descriptive in the issue body, too. Say what you want to do, and ideally what the method should be named.
	- Be understanding if I don't think that your feature request falls within the scope of this module.
