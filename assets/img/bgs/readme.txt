Important Notes for Changing the Backgrounds

Make sure that all Files are saved with the .jpg format (all other files wont get detected)
Make sure that all Files are named bg-!NUMBER!.jpg where it should start with 1.
After the changes edit in the index.html the "backgroundimagescount=XX" and replace the Number (in this case XX) to the highest number.
